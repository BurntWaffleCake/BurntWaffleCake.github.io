  <h1>But Why Have a Digital Portfolio?</h1>
  <p>A Digital Portfolio allows me and others to show off our accomplishments as well as aspects about ourselves that
    may be of interest. The portfolio can be used to show off a various number of things starting from projects to
    pictures and even programs. These items can then be presented to colleges or job sights in order to gain credit for
    the work you did. It also serves as a medium to represent your creativity whilst also providing you an avenue to
    learn about the intricacies of website development and design.</p>
