        <h1>Ball Collision Optimization</h1>

        <h2>Limitation of Brute Force Circle Collision</h2>
        <p>
          You may have noticed the fact that spawning a lot of balls in the previous article's simulation quickly negatively impacts the performance of the simulation. The previous simulation took a
          brute-force approach to checking collision. Each ball is compared with every other ball meaning the number of comparisons quickly increases as the number of balls increases (in this case the
          number of comparisons is equal to \( n^2 \) where \(n\) is the number of balls present).
        </p>

        <h2>Spatial Partitioning</h2>
        <p>
          One way to optimize collisions is to use spatial partitioning. Spatial partitioning is the act of separating space into partitions or groups which, in this case, can be used to cull unneeded
          comparisons between physics objects. There are many types of spatial partitioning each with their own pros and cons which we will discuss below.
        </p>

        <h3>Grid Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          One way to improve the overall performance of the simulation is to split the workspace (simulation area) into a grid. Each ball is associated with a grid cell assigned before the collision
          calculation cycle. The grid cells with balls are then iterated through and balls in ONLY the adjacent grid cells are compared to the balls in the current grid cell. This culls any ball in
          grid cells not adjacent to the current grid cell, excluding them in the comparison. This can vastly decrease the number of comparisons needed per ball improving overall performance,
          especially with a larger number of balls.
        </p>
        <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p>
          The grid optimization is relatively simple to implement and easy to understand; however, there are also several cons to is usage. The optimization's simplicity is only extended to balls of
          the same size, a property which is exploited by the optimization by setting the grid's cell size to the ball's diameter. Even with this limitation, this optimization can still be used to
          simulate fluids and particle interactions.
