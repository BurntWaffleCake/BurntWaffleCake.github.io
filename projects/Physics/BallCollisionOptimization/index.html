        <h1>Ball Collision Optimization</h1>

        <h2>Limitation of Brute Force Circle Collision</h2>
        <p>
          You may have noticed the fact that spawning a lot of balls in the previous article's simulation quickly negatively impacts the performance of the simulation. The previous simulation took a
          brute-force approach to checking collision. Each ball is compared with every other ball meaning the number of comparisons quickly increases as the number of balls increases (in this case the
          number of comparisons is equal to \( n^2 \) where \(n\) is the number of balls present).
        </p>

        <h2>Spatial Partitioning</h2>
        <p>
          One way to optimize collisions is to use spatial partitioning. Spatial partitioning is the act of separating space into partitions or groups which, in this case, can be used to cull unneeded
          comparisons between physics objects. There are many types of spatial partitioning each with their own pros and cons which we will discuss below.
        </p>

        <h3>Grid Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          One way to improve the overall performance of the simulation is to split the workspace (simulation area) into a grid. Each ball is associated with a grid cell assigned before the collision
          calculation cycle. The grid cells with balls are then iterated through and balls in ONLY the adjacent grid cells are compared to the balls in the current grid cell. This culls any ball in
          grid cells not adjacent to the current grid cell, excluding them in the comparison. This can vastly decrease the number of comparisons needed per ball improving overall performance,
          especially with a larger number of balls.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p>
          The grid optimization is relatively simple to implement and easy to understand; however, there are also several cons to is usage. The optimization's simplicity is only extended to balls of
          the same size, a property which is exploited by the optimization by setting the grid's cell size to the ball's diameter. Even with this limitation, this optimization can still be used to
          simulate fluids and particle interactions.

        <h3>Recursive Spatial Partitioning</h3>
        <p>
          The term "recursive spatial partitioning" can be attributed to a number of different types of spatial partitioning. Some of these include binary partitioning, octal and quad trees, and an
          infinite number of other data structures that each follow the same concept of recursing. This type of spatial partitioning splits the workspace into equally sized partitions each of which
          can then be split into their own partitions. For example, in binary space partitioning the workspace is split in half (hence the binary part of the optimization) recursively forming a binary
          tree of sorts. This is similar to the spatial separation found in grid optimizations except it is not limited by the size of grid cells.
        </p>

        <div class="image-holder" style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
          <img class="" style="width: 20%" src="./images/binaryTree.drawio.svg" />
        </div>

        <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p>
          Recursive spatial partitioning is a simple concept that is harder to implement than optimizations such as grid optimization due to the non uniform size of each partition. The size of each
          partition can change relative to how you divide (binary, quad, octal, etc.) the workspace along with the actual size of the workspace. Another complication is actually assigning each physics
          object to the partitions which can be tricky especially with non uniformly sized physics objects.
