        <h1>Box Collision</h1>

        <h2>Basic Polygon Collision</h2>
        <p>
          Balls are the simplest collision shape we need to handle. Unfortunately, most complex volumes are not made up of only balls and instead use complex polygons and shapes to fully or partially
          represent itself. In our case with 2D collision, triangles are the most basic shape we can decompose these volumes into. This article will not go into triangle and other decomposition
          algorithms and instead focus on collision between box or rectangular volumes.
        </p>

        <h2>AABB Box Collision</h2>
        <p>
          AABB collision is the most simple way to calculate the collision between two boxes. All of the edges of the box we want to collide is mapped to the x and y axis of the coordinate frame we
          are using. This means that all colliders do not have rotation allowing for every efficient and fast calculations to test for collision. In our case (with 2d collision), we only need to test
          the x and y axis to see if two colliders are colliding which we can calculate using the overlap of the projection of these shapes onto said axis. If these projections do not overlap in any
          of the tested axis, we can conclude that the two volumes are not colliding. This concept of using projections is further expanded in the SAT collision algorithm.

        <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
        <p>
          AABB is extremely fast compared to other collision algorithms and its simple nature allows for efficient and fast calculations. This is why many games use AABB when testing for collision
          using bounding boxes that encapsulate the entire body that needs collision. This, however, comes at the cost of precision as AABB is locked to the axis and does not allow any rotation. AABB
          also only represents a box and is unable to test for collision between more complex geometry. AABB serves as an excellent approximation of a body's volume and is often used as an
          optimization method for more complex collision algorithms.
        </p>

        <h2>SAT Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
          SAT or Separating Axis Theorem is a method of finding collision using a set of axis and overlaps between projections. The overlap calculations from AABB is applicable here with the max and
          min points being derived by projecting the colliding geometries onto an arbitrary axis instead of using the x and y axis. SAT allows for our boxes to have rotation and can be extended to any
          convex polygon (any line drawn across a geometry can not have move than 2 points of intersection with that geometry). SAT uses an arbitrarily large number of axis to find whether two
          geometries collide, however; we only need to test a set number of them in order to determine whether two geometries are colliding. These axis can be obtained by fetching all the normals of
          both geometries, ignoring any normals that are parallel to existing axis. By projecting both geometries to these axis and making sure every axis has an overlap, we can guarantee a
          collision/overlap between those two geometries (as long as they are both convex).
