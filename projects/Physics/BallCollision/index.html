        <h1>Ball Collision</h1>

        <h2>What is Ball Collision?</h2>
        <p>
          Ball Collision (or in this case circle collision as we are going to mostly be in 2d), is a way of detecting the overlap or collision of two ball objects. This can very simply be done using
          certain properties that each ball holds along with relational data between said balls.
        </p>

        <h3>Point In Circle Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          From this point forward we will reference balls as circles however the mathematics can be applied to higher dimensions such as with spheres. We can define a circle as an enclosed geometry
          which has an infinite number of definable points each a distance of its radius from its center. As such, we can know that a point lies inside of a circle if its distance from the center of
          said circle is less than the radius and on the surface of the circle if the distance is equal to the circle's radius.
        </p>

        <p class="equation">\( \vec{d} = \begin{vmatrix} x_{circle} - x_{point} \\ y_{circle} - y_{point} \end{vmatrix} \) <br /></p>
        <p class="equation">\( |\vec{d}| = \sqrt{ {\vec{d}_x}^2 + {\vec{d}_y}^2 } \) <br /></p>
        <p class="equation">\( l_{distance} = |\vec{d}| \)</p>
        <p class="equation">Point is in circle when: \( l_{distance} < r_{radius}\)</p>

        <h3>Circle In Circle Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          We now know that a point is in a circle if the distance between the point and the center of the circle is less than the circle's radius. Using this relationship and the fact that all points
          on a circle is exactly the distance of the circle's radius from its center, we can deduce that the if the distance between the two circles is less than sum of two circle's radii, they are
          colliding. We can in turn calculate the overlap or "depth" of the collision by subtracting the distance from the sum of radii giving us the overlap magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>Where \(a\) and \(b\) are circles:</p>
        <p class="equation">\( r_{sum} = r_a + r_b\)</p>
        <p class="equation">\( l_{distance} = |\vec{a_{pos}} - \vec{b_{pos}}| \)</p>
        <p class="equation">Circles are colliding when: \( l_{distance} < r_{sum} \)</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Collision Response</h3>
        <p>
          A collision response occurs after a collision is detected and is used to change certain attributes regarding each of the circles. For example, we could make the circles bounce off of one
          another when the collision occurs. In this article, we will only consider a simplified collision response meaning momentum will not be accurately represented. To properly position each of
          the circles, we can use the depth that we found previously scaled along the position delta vector to offset each of the circles equally.
