			<h1>Decision Making</h1>
			<h2>What Are Biases?</h2>
			<p>A bias is "an inclination of temperament or outlook especially a personal and sometimes unreasoned
				judgment" (Merriam Webster, 2022). Humans have always had biases that are constantly changing due to the
				person's own experiences as well as through outside influences that range from varying sources. These
				biases end up changing decisions and/or affecting our interpretation of information and usage of said
				information and can both negatively and positively affect how we go about living life and solving
				problems. </p>
			<h2>The Biases of Our ISP</h2>
			<p>There is a plethora of biases that influenced and will influence our ISP project during and after the
				development process. These biases affect the way we interpret our work and can change the thinking
				process behind the design decisions of our work. The following are some common biases that may affect
				our ISP along with a short explanation of why they exist and the possible impact they will have on our
				project.</p>

			<h3>The Dunning Kruger Effect</h3>
			<p>The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a bias that implies the ability of a person to perceive a concept as
				simplistic because of prior knowledge about the subject. Simply put, the less you know about something,
				the less complicated it appears to you. Many of us have just started to get into a deep dive into the
				world of computer science and its practical applications in the real world. I have been tunnel visioned
				into specific aspects of computer science and have been trying to expand my knowledge through programs
				such as the Python and Java certifications along with indulging in programs and topics that I have not
				had the opportunity to look into previously. I am not an expert when it comes to game design and our
				entire ISP is built on the premise of creating a fully functioning game that is of acceptable quality.
				The limited knowledge I have surrounding the different aspects of game design may result in me
				simplifying and underthinking how to approach certain problems and having too much confidence in the
				code I write. This problem will be alleviated through the discussion I have with my teammates as I have
				and can rely on multiple perspectives on solving the problems that arise as our ISP develops.</p>

			<h3>Self-Serving Bias</h3>
			<p>The self-serving bias indicates that a person will tend to assume that good outcomes are the result of
				positive actions that that person has done and bad outcomes are the result of other people's mistakes or
				outside forces. The self-serving bias affects me through the opinions I hold and develop about the
				people around me. I need to accept the fact that there are people who are both stronger and weaker than
				me at coding and computer science in general and that I should be flexible enough to accommodate both of
				these group types. The problems and challenges that arise from the development process are a result of
				decisions that are made by the <i>group</i> altogether and therefore constitute the need for <i>all</i>
				group members to be able to understand and apply the knowledge gained from tackling said
				challenge/problem. The good outcomes of our project are not the result of just me but rather the
				collective effort made by all group members (assuming that communication is held properly).</p>

			<h3>Optimism Bias</h3>
			<p>Optimism bias is the tendency for a person to be over-optimistic about the abilities that they have,
				causing them to overestimate the likelihood of achieving favorable outcomes. Our team wants to include a
				multitude of features in our ISP which may result in overestimating the efficiency of our work progress.
				Too many features may result in a cluttered end product, delays, and even the eventual inability to
				complete our project. We need to closely follow the plans we create to ensure that we can complete the
				final product and deliver all the features we want to include in our ISP. This in turn means that I will
				have to make sure that the planning of our ISP is securely in place and that I am following the plan
				closely to ensure the efficiency of our development process.</p>

			<h3>Gender Bias + Ageism</h3>
			<p>Gender bias refers to the preference a person has over one gender over another while Ageism describes the
				discrimination of certain age groups. Both of these biases can be attributed to the target audience we
				are aiming to conform to, which consists of teenage kids most of which will be male. This focusing on a
				certain age group and gender can become a beneficial decision as it allows us to target a specific topic
				or genre that conforms to the wants and needs of the said age group; however, focusing on a certain
				target audience can also limit creativity and put strict bounds on the amount and quality of our ISP and
				could result in a situation where we are unable to create a product we are satisfied with. We should
				keep our target audience as a reference point rather than a limit to what we add to our ISP that way we
				can create a product targeted towards a certain group while still being able to be flexible.</p>
