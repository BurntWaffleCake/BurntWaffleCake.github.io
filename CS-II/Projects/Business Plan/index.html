      <h1>The Plan</h1>
      <p>There are several wacky games out there such as Deer Simulator and Goat Simulator that have achieved unwaranted
        levels of successful with millions of downloads and coverage by multiple large influencers. These types of games
        serve as peculiar examples of successes as they are not exactly created for a certain audience like other games
        are. Our goal is to meld this type of fun and unexpected gameplay with the multiplayer capabilites presented by
        the roblox engine.</p>

      <h2>Why Roblox?</h2>
      <p>Roblox is a game creation and distribution company founded in September 1, 2006. It has gone on to attract over
        200 million users and has become a icon of the younger generation entertainment market. The reason as to the use
        of roblox instead of more powerful engines such as unity or unreal engine is due to the simplicity of using the
        engine itself as well as the built in multiplayer integration which will allow us to easily make multiplayer
        without having to spend extra money on running servers. Roblox also provides us with a source of revenue through
        its robux integration program which will be our primary way of getting funds. Roblox's community consists of
        mostly younger childeren which will be the primary age range target for the game. Later stages of developement
        will also allow for mobile integration as roblox also supports compatability between a multitude of consoles
        (pc, console, mobile, etc.).</p>
