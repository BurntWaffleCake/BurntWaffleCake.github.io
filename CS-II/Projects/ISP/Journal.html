			<h3>To Do: Personal Plans</h3>
			<p>AP Exams are prevalent and not much is left to do on the project. This week will mostly be final
				polishing and any last minute features we want to add. Entire team will work on final presentation which
				will include a general overview of what our team accomplished, failed to accomplish, and hope to change
				on the next project.</p>

			<h3>Final Overview</h3>
			<p>This project had several twists and turns where ideas were thrown about in a melting pot on a full blast.
				There were a lot of features that were originally planned that didn't make it into the final game or
				were outright blacklisted due to technical incapability or lack of good practices. The final outcome is
				very different from what we originally planned but our entire team is proud of what we were able to
				accomplish and have learned much along the way. Several external factors such as other classes and AP
				Exams on the final couple weeks of development have caused a lot of stress but those have passed now and
				we are proud to present the completed Goose Game.</p>

			<h3>To Do: Personal Plans</h3>
			<p>Most of the enemies are now done and ready to be implemented into a round based system. The rounds will
				continue until all players are dead and are no longer able to continue fighting the enemies. There will
				be a heavy focus on adding new weapons and compiling the current bosses we have into round/wave oriented
				gameplay. We originally wanted to make the game into a dungeon crawler / rogue like esk game however
				several delays and time constraints have changed the overall product again. The final product will act
				more like a showcase of what our framework has and can achieve.</p>

			<h2>18-Apr-2023</h2>

			<h3>To Do: Personal Plans</h3>
			<p>This week will there will be a heavy focus on completing the AI and logic for the enemies (bosses,
				minions, etc.) We are planning to complete at least 4 - 5 bosses by the end of this week with debugging
				and other problems solved/fixed. These bosses will be the main meat of our game and should be of
				satisfactory quality with little to no issues. Each boss will have their own set of unique attacks that
				the player will have to learn to beat said boss. Some bosses may have phases depending on the situation
				they are in. We will need to have as little unnecessary errors as possible to avoid potential points of
				failure.</p>

			<h2>03-Apr-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>A simpler and more efficient pathfinding algorithm was created but it lacks a good way to scale heights.
				The system uses an array of nodes to determine a direction with the least weight for the AI to travel
				in. The algorithm itself is very simple and includes various tests to ensure that the path is viable.
				Unfortunately, the algorithm lacks a good way to test for height changes such as through ramps or stairs
				and will tend to stay at the same elevation as it currently is. We have determined that this is a better
				compromise than using the older pathfinding system as it was much more performance intensive than our
				new algorithm.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Meetings are still a problem as less and less time is available for our members to meet. Tests and other
				projects are still getting in the way of development and slowing progress down. Our goal is to get as
				many meetings together as we can with a focus on how our game will look and compromises due to time
				constraints.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>We are severely lacking good ideas to incorporate into our game such as for weapons, map designs, and
				other design choices. The basic framework for our game is in place and ready to go but with no idea of
				what to create, progress has been hampered for a long time. A lot of our development focus has shifted
				from the workings of the game itself to what we need to include to create a cohesive game with a central
				theme in mind.</p>

			<h2>27-Mar-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>We have run into several issues with Roblox's pathfinding services and have decided to simplify our AI
				down and exclude the usage of the pathfinding service in our enemies. This has resulted in a need to
				create a watered-down version of a pathfinding AI and will be one of the major challenges our developers
				will have to overcome. We expect our version of pathfinding to be more performant than Roblox's and will
				allow us to increase the number of enemies in our game.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Meetings are more available for our team but approaching due dates and test days have severely limited
				our capability to work on the ISP. A new scripter schedule has been put in place to make sure we can
				meet our project goals and finish our product in time for the deadline. This includes a revised timeline
				and a separation of goals into parts every week. This has been put in place to make sure everyone on our
				team is working and has something to do to ensure the timely execution of our plans.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>One of our teammates has not been able to use computers for extended periods due to their parents. This
				has been an ongoing problem and a solution has not been available as it is a family issue. This has
				impacted our productivity to a certain extent, however, we feel that there are other methods for this
				individual to partake in the production of this project.</p>

			<h2>20-Mar-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>Our main Entity module has been completed to conform with the new OOP system we are using as well as
				combining the player and enemy logic. Debugging the code to make sure that no mistakes were made during
				the development has begun which will finish shortly. New AI needs to be written for our enemies which
				will slow down progress however we hope the new Entity system will make it much easier to implement new
				enemies.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Our lead developer is back and has begun working on the project once more. More meetings are planned to
				be held as the major Cyber Security season is over. The due date is getting closer with slower progress
				than anticipated which has prompted our team to work harder to get the game done by the deadline.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>Changes to the weapons in our game have begun to pop up as new features are being implemented and due to
				plans to shorten the final product to only include a portion of the original plan. This has resulted in
				some of our teammates disagreeing over how weapons should be balanced and which weapons to add. Some of
				our teammates also disagree on how over the top we want our game to be which has resulted in several
				ideas being scrapped or changed to fit the style of our game.

			<h2>13-Mar-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>A large portion of the conversion to the new OOP has been completed. We are in the process of reworking
				our entity system to make it easier to use and to flesh out any major bugs regarding the logic behind
				the enemies. Combining the player and enemies into a unified entity system will allow us to easily make
				certain features compatible between the two systems. For example, our original code had two separate
				handlers for status effects for players and enemies. Our new code combines these two separate code
				sections into a unified class.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>The Cyber Security finals have arrived which has taken our lead developer away from working on the
				project. He has notified us that he will still be able to work on the project throughout his trip to
				Bethesda but we are anticipating a lack of progress due to his absence. </p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>Our team is having to rethink many of the choices we made during the planning phase of the project.
				Although the ideas were good, we may have to scrap a significant portion of them due to production
				delays and overall overambition. We think that if we were given more time much more would be able to be
				accomplished but as of now, a large portion of our project will have to be put on hold for our team to
				focus on a smaller portion of our game rather than make the entire thing rushed.</p>

			<h2>6-Mar-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>A flaw in our current code has resulted in a complete scrap of many parts of our code. Lua allows
				programmers to use metatables to create sudo object-oriented coding. This means there are several
				different ways to approach using OOP. Unfortunately, the current way we are doing OOP is less efficient
				than the way we plan to change it in that our current way stores functions as part of the object whereas
				the new way uses metatable reference towards the object's methods which allows us to use less memory per
				object we create.
			</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>A cybersecurity CTF known as PicoCTF has leeched some of our members from working full-time on our game.
				This has resulted in even less communication regarding the project along with even less productivity as
				attention is being drawn to the competition instead of the project. Our team is hoping attention will be
				diverted back to the project after the conclusion of the competition.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>Our team has gone completely off of the original roles we assigned each other and are now working as a
				hodgepodge group with many not knowing what exactly they should work on. This has been amplified by the
				fact that many on our team still have not learned how to use the Roblox engine properly. This has become
				increasingly frustrating as this problem has persisted for multiple weeks at this point with little to
				no progress being made by these members.</p>

			<hr class="solid">
			</hr>

			<h2>27-Feb-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>The current way we are handling player and enemy models and logic are flawed in that they are independent
				systems from one another. This may work for games where the player and enemy systems are catered towards
				supporting their features; however, we want our players and entities to be synonymous with one another
				to allow easy application of features such as status effects, health handling, and others. This has
				resulted in a significant amount of code being rewritten to adorn the generalization of the players and
				enemies through a module that we are calling "entity".</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Our team is still having trouble making time for meetings and with English ISPs being due very soon even
				less time has been allocated toward the production of our game. Our small team of developers is working
				hard to make up for the lost time but progress is still slow with such a small team amplified by the
				fact that our developers are also having trouble making time for our game.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>Many of our teammates are unable to use Roblox's coding platform due to their lack of knowledge of the
				software and systems. This has become a major problem as our team has been warned thoroughly about not
				being able to use the application to its fullest. This has resulted in an asymmetric amount of work
				being filtered toward our developers which have slowed progress and even put it to a standstill at
				times.</p>

			<hr class="solid">
			</hr>

			<h2>20-Feb-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>The current level creation workflow for our project is based on a directory search-based algorithm that
				has resulted in several problems when creating new areas for our map. The rooms themselves are not fit
				for optimal gameplay and can get laggy when many are loaded at once. The Roblox Engine itself is not
				known to handle thousands of instances being rendered at once very well so this performance issue is
				also another problem in need of fixing.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Our team is having more and more trouble finding optimal dates to hold meetings which has resulted in
				less discussion regarding producing the actual game. Other issues regarding the availability and ability
				to learn the ways to create games on Roblox have resulted in slow progress with only one or two
				developers working on the project. Other projects have started to pop up in other classes which have
				also slowed the progress of development.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>Motivation is still at a low with our team having to deal with other classes, tests, assignments, and
				such. Many of our teammates have not been available for meetings both in person and online and have been
				asked to indulge in other projects which have in turn hurt the productivity of our game. We are hoping
				that with the passing of many of the tests that have come our way, we will be able to continue work more
				efficiently.</p>

			<hr class="solid">
			</hr>

			<h2>13-Feb-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>One issue our team is running into is the referencing and usage of different values that pertain to the
				player's statistics. For example, the movement speed of the player is accessed through the player's
				character while the health is accessed from the server. This has resulted in problems when implementing
				features such as buffs which require open and easy access to these values. We are currently discussing
				implementing an all-encompassing library that will hold all values about the player. This would solve
				issues regarding unwieldy access to information about the player but may slow down the process as many
				of the aspects of our game will have to be modified to work with the new system.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Scheduling meetings have remained an issue that has yet to be properly solved. The meetings that were
				originally planned for Saturday evenings have had little attendance and progress/planning accomplished
				during said meetings has been minimal to none. With the Cyber Security program now over for many of the
				teams that participated, we expect that meetings will become more frequent to ensure the success of our
				project.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>With new topics and assignments directed toward our teammates that do not pertain to computer science or
				our ISP project, motivation generally decreased throughout our team. The momentum we had at the
				beginning of the project has slowly fizzled as other projects have plagued us that do not benefit the
				development of the game. This has significantly reduced the progress we are making in our project and
				may result in us having to reduce the amount of content we had initially wanted to make.</p>

			<h2>30-Jan-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>The projectile system has now been fixed to use a system that integrates both the client and server.
				After receiving a projectile request from the client, the server will spawn its own projectile and then
				request a cosmetic projectile to be spawned in all clients. This ensures that collisions and hits are
				detected consistently while removing problems that had to do with where projectiles were spawning. We
				are now in the process of converting our old classes to work with the new system as well as making sure
				any other class that uses projectiles also works. </p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>A long bad weather weekend has forced us to cancel one of our in-person meetings. We have resorted to
				using discord to hold a meeting instead however I still feel that having in-person meetings will be much
				more productive than ones online. </p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>One of our teammates has gone suspiciously quiet for a long time now. They are not known to reach out to
				us often but have not reached out to us at all for almost 2 and a half weeks now. We are currently
				trying to reach them again but with little success. Hopefully, we can get in contact with them again for
				the sake of our project as well as their well-being.</p>

			<hr class="solid">
			</hr>

			<h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>The projectile system that we are currently using requires an update due to several circumstances
				regarding hit detection. In the current system we use, the player equips a tool that in turn is used to
				spawn projectiles. The client sends a request to the server which then receives the request, processes
				the information, executes a sanity check on the information, then sends a request to all clients
				(including the original client) to spawn in a projectile. The main problem with this regards how to hit
				detection and the actual spawning of the projectile happens in the client. Although testing for hits in
				the client may seem like a better experience for the user, we plan to implement multiplayer into our
				game making testing for hits and collisions in the server much more consistent than in the client.
				Another problem that rises is that another request has to be sent to the server regarding when and where
				the hit happened. This could introduce an unwanted delay between the projectile request, spawning, and
				hit detection.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Due to many of our teammates working or being occupied during the weekends and weekdays, many of our
				meetings had to be shortened or omitted due to insufficient attendance. This has become a serious
				problem and could result in a reduction of motivation for the project. We are currently working together
				to solve this problem; however, it seems that this and the following week will also be following the
				trend mentioned above.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>Although we have tried to standardize the platform we use to communicate, it is becoming more difficult
				to reach out to some of our team members. They are stating that their parents either do not allow them
				to use the form of communication at all or in very short intervals which have made contacting them
				regarding aspects of our project difficult. We are currently trying to get them to talk to their parents
				regarding their situation as this lack of communication could result in the inability for them to
				receive important announcements.</p>

			<h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>The room generation algorithm has been completed and is flexible enough to permit different types of
				generation for different stages/levels. Our team is not working on creating rooms to be used in this
				algorithm and has been attempting to keep all of our assets as light as possible (performance). A rarity
				system is planned to be implemented for our items which will be picked up from chests that are randomly
				generated throughout the level. A new class that assists with random generation logic will be created
				that will help us with other aspects of our game other than the rarity of items.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>This week presents us with less than ample time to work on our ISP together. The Cyber Patriot
				competition takes place the day before our official meeting and has resulted in a notable portion of our
				time allocated to cybersecurity efforts. Some of the work originally intended for this week may have to
				be pushed to next week. We plan to put together a very basic beta of our game which will include the map
				generation, basic enemies and weapons, and a boss. We plan to get this created by around mid-February.
			</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>Due to numerous external conflicts with meeting dates along with other events, not a lot of communication
				has happed between our teammates this week. We plan to regroup on Sunday to get back on track and
				discuss further developments in our game. Most of the framework is in place and what remains is
				implementing assets and further polishing the performance and look of our game, a topic to be discussed
				in this week's meeting.</p>

			<hr class="solid">

			<h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>Some of our teammates are unable to bring devices capable of running Roblox Studio to school due to
				restrictions placed by their parents or the school entity. This has limited our ability to work while in
				leisure time (privilege periods) and may negatively impact our work schedule as school is a guaranteed
				source of in-person meetings. We are currently working towards making sure everyone can access our main
				project file whether that be in school or at home. Physical copies of our game have also been added to
				multiple devices as well as to the main GitHub repository to ensure backups are present in case of file
				corruption or memory loss.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Meeting dates have been set to Sunday evenings and unofficial Wednesday meetings are also being held.
				These meetings are used to log planning and development progress in the game and can be used to change
				aspects of our game and serve as a semi-guaranteed method of reaching out to all members through voice
				chat and/or physical meetings. A problem that has arisen is the consistency of times available on
				Sundays. Some of our teammates have work and/or are unavailable during varying times due to religious
				meets as well as other external factors. This has caused the meetings to have a variable time and may
				result in problems in the future. Other possible days are currently being discussed.</p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>We are currently lacking good ideas as to how our game will look and work. Our game needs multiple enemy
				and weapon types and a layout as to how these weapons will function, interact with other components of
				our game, and be created through the Roblox engine are essential to ensure smooth development. Although
				many ideas are being thrown around our team in both official and unofficial meetings, many have turned
				out to be unrealistic, impractical, and outright senseless. Those deemed to have some semblance of sense
				have been shallow in terms of details as to their functionality and mechanics. This has caused
				development to bottleneck and could turn out to extend the estimated time before we can put together a
				functional game.</p>

			<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
			<p>The usage of the Roblox engine has provided our team with a multitude of technical challenges. Roblox was
				built around the Lua programming language which is less performant than languages such as C++ or Java.
				Although the Roblox engine was created to be run on a multitude of devices including lower-end computers
				and phones, this limitation presented by the coding language makes advanced and/or bulk computation
				close to impossible to do efficiently in real-time. Another problem presented by the usage of the Roblox
				engine is the lack of features present in other game engines. One major example of this is mesh
				manipulation where meshes can be generated through the usage of scripts or modified to meet the
				programmer's needs. This results in us having to use workarounds or completely void ideas due to the
				limitations of the engine.</p>

			<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
			<p>Because our entire school career is not just based on computer science, many of our teammates have other
				work to do for other classes. Some of our teammates have jobs and other extracurricular activities that
				have hindered our ability to meet together and discuss the ISP project. To alleviate this issue, we are
				planning to create a discord server where we can have immediate contact with one another as well as plan
				sessions and optimize overall workflow. </p>

			<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
			<p>One of our teammates has refused to get into contact with the rest of the team which has resulted in a
				confused ordeal regarding the disposition, sanity, and presence of said teammate. Multiple emails from
				multiple people on our team were sent to the person with no replies or any measure taken for contact. We
				are currently attempting to find other methods of contacting the said teammate to verify their presence
				and their willingness to participate in the ISP project as well as integrate them into our current and
				future plans.</p>

			<h2>Roles</h2>
			<h3>Software Development Engineer</h3>
			<p>Software Development Engineers are people who program and design software that meets the needs of their
				targeted audience. They are the foundational builders of a product and are responsible for the creation,
				deployment, and maintenance of a product. The most prevalent role in the creation of Goose Simulator
				will be the Software Developer/Engineer as many people are needed to program a fully-fledged game.
				Because many of our teammates are less acquainted with the programing language Lua that the Roblox
				engine uses, there may be a significant lack of efficiency when it comes to programming the game. To
				alleviate this problem, a very concrete planning stage will have to take place to prioritize the most
				important components needed in the game while allowing the other teammates to catch up. This role is
				best suited for me in the current situation of our Isp group as I am the most familiar with Lua at this
				point. My current goal is to develop and needed modules for our game so that our creation process after
				the planning is complete will be as smooth and simple as possible for our other teammates.</p>
			<h3>QA Engineer</h3>
			<p>QA (Quality Assurance) Engineers are people who review the product to identify and document issues
				through a series of coordinated tests on the product. As their name suggests, QA Engineers are essential
				in assuring the quality of the product they are working on and can be a buffer to catch both basic and
				major issues presented by the product. All of our teammates will have to act as QA Engineers eventually
				as our project comes to an end. The more people there are to catch bugs, errors, and issues with the
				game, and the faster these problems are caught, the more we will be able to fix them before our deadline
				approaches us. My main goal will be to review parts of the code to find bad coding practices along with
				ways to simplify or improve the efficiency of parts of our game. This will improve the overall
				performance of our game allowing for further reach to people with lower-end devices along with
				alleviating some of the shortcomings of the Lua programming language.</p>
			<h3>Project Manager</h3>
			<p>Project Managers are the people in charge of the entire product manufacturing, planning, and launching
				process. They are involved with almost all the parts of finishing and releasing a product and are a very
				important role that can define whether a product will fail or succeed. Although having a key figure in a
				products designing proccess is critical to its success, the fundamental structure of our team, and the
				way it formed, prevents a singular leader who determines the course of the entire project. </p>
			<h3>Product Manager</h3>
			<p>Product Managers are people who identify the needs of the target audience and create the main goals of
				the product. They are the ones responsible for creating the roadmap and defining the features that
				should be present in the product to gain the maximum amount of profit from the target audience. Due to
				the somewhat small size of our team (5 people), many (if not most) of our teammates will already be part
				of the planning process to create a product that we are satisfied with. The creation of goals for our
				project is essential in the process of making our game to prevent hiccups and creative deadends that may
				arise in our development process.
			</p>
			<h3>Release Engineer</h3>
			<p>Release Engineers are responsible for managing and overseeing the data and data transfer of files and
				other resources that are part of the product's design. These can include online repositories of code as
				well as other source code from programs and software that the company needs. To maintain the legitimacy
				of our code and game, we will need to keep a multitude of backups and keep our code as secure as
				possible along with making sure to take into place the usage of insecure and inappropriate clients.
				Roblox already keeps a cloud network that stores games and can be used to access information about the
				players that will interact with our product. However, we will also keep weekly physical file copies of
				our game on multiple devices to prepare for an event where our main file is lost.</p>
