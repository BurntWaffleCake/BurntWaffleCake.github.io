	<h3>Technical challenges</h3>
	<p>The usage of the Roblox engine has provided our team with a multitude of technical challenges. Roblox was built around the Lua programming language which is less performant than languages such as C++ or Java. Although the Roblox engine was created to be run on a multitude of devices including lower-end computers and phones, this limitation presented by the coding language makes advanced and/or bulk computation close to impossible to do efficiently in real-time. Another problem presented by the usage of the Roblox engine is the lack of features present in other game engines. One major example of this is mesh manipulation where meshes can be generated through the usage of scripts or modified to meet the programmer's needs. This results in us having to use workarounds or completely void ideas due to the limitations of the engine.</p>

	<h3>Scheduling challenges</h3>
	<p>Because our entire school career is not just based on computer science, many of our teammates have other work to do for other classes. Some of our teammates have jobs and other extracurricular activities that have hindered our ability to meet together and discuss the ISP project. To alleviate this issue, we are planning to create a discord server where we can have immediate contact with one another as well as plan sessions and optimize overall workflow. </p>
	
	<h3>Interpersonal challenges</h3>
	<p>One of our teammates has refused to get into contact with the rest of the team which has resulted in a confused ordeal regarding the disposition, sanity, and presence of said teammate. Multiple emails from multiple people on our team were sent to the person with no replies or any measure taken for contact. We are currently attempting to find other methods of contacting the said teammate to verify their presence and their willingness to participate in the ISP project as well as integrate them into our current and future plans.</p>

	<h3>Roles</h3>
	<h3>Software Development Engineer</h3>
	<p>Software Development Engineers are people who program and design software that meets the needs of their targeted audience. They are the foundational builders of a product and are responsible for the creation, deployment, and maintenance of a product. The most prevalent role in the creation of Goose Simulator will be the Software Developer/Engineer as many people are needed to program a fully-fledged game. Because many of our teammates are less acquainted with the programing language Lua that the Roblox engine uses, there may be a significant lack of efficiency when it comes to programming the game. To alleviate this problem, a very concrete planning stage will have to take place to prioritize the most important components needed in the game while allowing the other teammates to catch up. This role is best suited for me in the current situation of our Isp group as I am the most familiar with Lua at this point. My current goal is to develop and needed modules for our game so that our creation process after the planning is complete will be as smooth and simple as possible for our other teammates.</p>
	<h3>QA Engineer</h3>
	<p>QA (Quality Assurance) Engineers are people who review the product to identify and document issues through a series of coordinated tests on the product. As their name suggests, QA Engineers are essential in assuring the quality of the product they are working on and can be a buffer to catch both basic and major issues presented by the product. All of our teammates will have to act as QA Engineers eventually as our project comes to an end. The more people there are to catch bugs, errors, and issues with the game, and the faster these problems are caught, the more we will be able to fix them before our deadline approaches us. My main goal will be to review parts of the code to find bad coding practices along with ways to simplify or improve the efficiency of parts of our game. This will improve the overall performance of our game allowing for further reach to people with lower-end devices along with alleviating some of the shortcomings of the Lua programming language.</p>
	<h3>Project Manager</h3>
	<p>Project Managers are the people in charge of the entire product manufacturing, planning, and launching process. They are involved with almost all the parts of finishing and releasing a product and are a very important role that can define whether a product will fail or succeed. Although having a key figure in a products designing proccess is critical to its success, the fundamental structure of our team, and the way it formed, prevents a singular leader who determines the course of the entire project. </p>
	<h3>Product Manager</h3>
	<p>Product Managers are people who identify the needs of the target audience and create the main goals of the product. They are the ones responsible for creating the roadmap and defining the features that should be present in the product to gain the maximum amount of profit from the target audience. Due to the somewhat small size of our team (5 people), many (if not most) of our teammates will already be part of the planning process to create a product that we are satisfied with. The creation of goals for our project is essential in the process of making our game to prevent hiccups and creative deadends that may arise in our development process.
	</p>
	<h3>Release Engineer</h3>
	<p>Release Engineers are responsible for managing and overseeing the data and data transfer of files and other resources that are part of the product's design. These can include online repositories of code as well as other source code from programs and software that the company needs. To maintain the legitimacy of our code and game, we will need to keep a multitude of backups and keep our code as secure as possible along with making sure to take into place the usage of insecure and inappropriate clients. Roblox already keeps a cloud network that stores games and can be used to access information about the players that will interact with our product. However, we will also keep weekly physical file copies of our game on multiple devices to prepare for an event where our main file is lost.</p>
