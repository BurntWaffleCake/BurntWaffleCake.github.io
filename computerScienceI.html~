    <h1>Computer Science I</h1>
    <p>
      Here are some things about by experience in <b>Computer Science I!</b><br>
      During the second semester of Computer Science, we did a project called the independant study project (ISP) where we could explore our own coding topics using the swift language and <b>IGIS</b> platform.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
      The concept behind our ISP project was to recreate <b>Flappy Bird</b> using the <b>IGIS</b> platform. We wanted to include customizability inside and outside of the code while retaining the basic gameplay mechanics of the orginal game.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The reasoning for choosing <b>Flappy Bird</b> instead of other games was due to its removal from the app store as well as its simplicity in gameplay and artstyle. Having just come out of learning how to use <b>IGIS</b> and Swift, we wanted a challenge but not something so amibtious but also praiseworthy, clean, and robust.
