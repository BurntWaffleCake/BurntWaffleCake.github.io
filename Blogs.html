				<h2>AI Regulation</h2>
				<p>AI has become a major topic of debate as the accessability and productivity of different AI models
					begins to increase. This begs the question, does AI need to be regulated? AI has gained a lot of
					momentum as of late with AI models such as Chat GPT being publically available for free which has
					resulted in many problems regarding educational integrity in schools, colleges, and univerisities.
					AIs are a great resource for easy access to information, summarizing, compiling, and other tools
					that can be used in a multitiude of different applications in a multitude of carreers. This does
					bring chances for mallcious usage, of course, which is a major point of debate and a supporting
					argument for heavily regulating the abilities of AI and their usage. AI can be a powerful tool and
					should be used as such but a need for regulation is present which has become more evident with the
					rapid pace AI has been advancing. </p>

					<h2>School District Policy: BYOD Network Policy</h2>
					<p>The allen high school policy surrounding the usage of personal computers in school has resulted
						in a banning of BYOD network connections outside of allen high school issued computers. This is
						significantly hamper the working efficiency and productivity of my work along with any type of
						project or activity I want to partake in during my school time. Many of the projects that I do
						in school already require me to use off hand ways to gain access to sites and resources that the
						high school has decided to block. The restrictions that they are preseting us are terrible in
						terms of logistics and is sugar coated by the insidious emails regarding the SUCCESS of the one
						on one device program. Not only is this a joke presented to us, the students, it is outrageous
						to say that the program is successful when there are numerous accounts regarding issues with
						school issued chromesbooks along with the restrictions they present. The hardware in the
						chromebooks are barely usable with slow speeds and argiously inefficient usage.</p>
