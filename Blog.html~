	<h2>School District Policy: BYOD Network Policy</h2>
	<p>The allen high school policy surrounding the usage of personal computers in school has resulted in a banning of BYOD network connections outside of allen high school issued computers. This is significantly hamper the working efficiency and productivity of my work along with any type of project or activity I want to partake in during my school time. Many of the projects that I do in school already require me to use off hand ways to gain access to sites and resources that the high school has decided to block. The restrictions that they are preseting us are terrible in terms of logistics and is sugar coated by the insidious emails regarding the SUCCESS of the one on one device program. Not only is this a joke presented to us, the students, it is outrageous to say that the program is successful when there are numerous accounts regarding issues with school issued chromesbooks along with the restrictions they present. The hardware in the chromebooks are barely usable with slow speeds and argiously inefficient usage.</p>
