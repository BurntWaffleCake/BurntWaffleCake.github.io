    <h2>Abstract</h2>
        This article will talk about 3 sorting algorithms: Mergesort, Quicksort, and Heapsort. These algorithms are common sorting algorithms with varying time and space complexities and all have their own advantages and disadvantages. This article will be going through how these algorithms work and their efficiencies compared to other common sorting algorithms such as bubblesort.

    <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
    <p>Merge sort works by separating an initial input array and then "merging" them together to a final sorted array output. The initial array is split into even halves (odd element counts allocate the remaining element to either the left or right array) recursively until only one element (or none in the case of odd elements) remains in each half. These partitions are then combined together sorting each element accordingly until all partitions are combined together.</p>

    <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
    <p>Merge sort is generally more efficient for larger arrays but requires much more memory than sorts such as quicksort and bubblesort. This is a consequence from the sorting algorithms external partitioning requiring extra temporary memory to store the subdivided arrays. Merge sort is also slow when applied to shorter arrays. </p>

    <h3>Time Complexity and Space Complexity:</h3>
    <p>Time Complexity: O(nLogn) (worst case and best case)<br />
        Space Complexity: O(n) <br />
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Sort</h2>
    <p>Quick sort works by first selecting a pivot (there are multiple ways to determine the best pivot however we will consider it the last element of the array in this case) and </p>
