	<h2>The Fundamental Counting Principle, Permutations and Combinations</h2>
	<p>One way to count problems is to list all possible solutions. For example, if 3 letter codes were selected using the four letters A, B, C, D with no repeats then the possible solutions would be such:<br>
	  ABC BAC CAB DAB<br>
	  ABD BAD CAD DBA<br>
	  ACB BCA CBA DBC<br>
	  ACD BDA CBD DCB<br>
	  ADB BCD CDB DCA<br>
	  ADC BDC CBA DAC<br>
	  Another way count problems is to make a factor tree and count the number of end branches. In this case, there are four possible results to flipping a coin twice:

	  A procedure P can broken into n successive ordered stages such that it is S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>n</sub>. If S<sub>1</sub> can occur r<sub>1</sub> ways and S<sub>2</sub> can occur r<sub>2</sub> ways ansd so forth until n, then S<sub>n</sub> can occur r<sub>n</sub> ways. We multiply all of the r values together meaning the number of ways P can occur is r<sub>1</sub> * r<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>n</sub>.

	<h3>Permutations</h3>
	<p>A counting problem where the order of elements does matter and each element can't be used more than once. 
	</p>
	<h3>Combinations</h3>
	<p>A counting problem where the order of the elements does not matter and each element cannot be used more that once.</p>

	<h2>Probability and Venn Diagrams</h2>
	<h3>Sample Space</h3>
	<p>The collection of all possible outcomes of a chance experiment. Ex. Rolling a dice: S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} </p>
	
	<h3>Event</h3>
	<p>Any collection of outcomes from the sample space. Ex. Rolling a prime #: E = {2,3,5} </p>

	<h3>Venn Diagram</h3>
	<p>Used to display relationships between events and are helpful in calculating probabilities.</p>

	<h3>Complement</h3>
	<p>Consists of all outcomes that are not in the event. Ex. rolling an even # complement: E<sup>c</sup> = {1,3,5}</p>

	</div>
	
	<h3>Union</h3>
	<p>The event A or B happening; consists of all outcomes that are in at least one of the two events (it can be both). Ex. Rolling a prime # or even #: E = {2,3,4,5,6}  E = A ∪ B</p>


	<h3>Intersection</h3>
	<p>The event A and B happening; consists of all outcomes that are in both events. Ex. Grabbing a red card and a 2: E = {2 hearts, 2 diamonds} E = A ∩ B</p>

	<h2>Basic Rules of Probability, Conditional Probability, Tree Diagrams</h2>
	<h3>Probability</h3>
	<p>Denoted by P(event): Amount of favorable Outcomes / Total amount of outcomes [This equation is true if outcomes are equally likely]</p>

	<h3>Experimental Probability</h3>
	<p>The relative frequency at which a change experiment actually occurs.</p>

	<h3>Law of Large Numbers</h3>
	<p>As the number of repetitions of a chance experiment increases, the difference between the theoretical and experimental probability approaches zero.</p>

	<h3>Basic Rulse of Probability</h3>
	<p>Independence - Two events are independent if knowing that one will occur does not change the probability that the other occurs. Check if two probabilities are independent using: P(A) * P (B) = P(A and B), P(A|B) = P(A), or P(B|A) = P(B)<br><br></p>
	
	<p>Rule 1 - Legitimate Values: for any even, 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1</p>
	<p>Rule 2 - Sample Space: if S is the sample space, P(S [all possible values] ) = 1 </p>
	<p>Rule 3 - Complement: for any event E, P(E) + P(not E) = 1 </p>
	<p>Rule 4 - A and B (Multiplication): If two event A & B are independent: P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B), If two events are not dependent(general solution): P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)</p>
	<p>Rule 5 - A or B (Addition): If two events are disjoint: P(E or F) = P(E) + P(F), If two events are not disjoint(general solution): P(E) + P(F) - P(E and F)</p>
	<p>Rule 6 - At least one: The probability of at least one outcome happening is 1 minus the probability that no outcome happens. P(at least 1) = 1 - P(none happens)</p>
	<p>Rule 7 - Conditional Probability: A probability that takes into account a given condition: P(B|A) = P(A and B)/P(A), P(B|A) = P(and)/P(Given)</p>

	<h3>Two Way Tables</h3>
	<p>Consists of the numbers of conditions met as well as their totals.</p>
